# 🎓 GEC Bilaspur Official App (Solo Developed) 📱

> “🎯 If a problem exists, it’s just waiting for me to build the solution. 🎯”

This mindset fueled a 6-month journey of solo development — and today, I’m proud to present the **official mobile app** for **Government Engineering College, Bilaspur (GECB)** — designed, developed, and deployed single-handedly.  
A centralized platform tailored for the GECB community to eliminate chaos and streamline communication.

## 🚩 The Problem

Important updates like class timetables, notices, and faculty info were scattered across WhatsApp groups — often lost in endless chats, missed, or forgotten.

This led to:
- Miscommunication
- Delay in information
- Lack of centralized access

---

## ✅ The Solution

A **real-time centralized mobile application** that streamlines all essential updates, curated specifically for the GECB student and admin community.
